| :---- | :---- |
| **RN** | Registered Nurse |
| **BP** | Blood Pressure |
| **SBP** | Systolic Blood Pressure |
| **LIP** | Licensed Independent Provider (physician, Advanced Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant) |
| **L\&D** | Labor and Delivery |
| **DBP** | Diastolic Blood Pressure |

## **3\. Procedure: (NOTE CAUTIONS IN BOLD ITALICS BEFORE STEP)**

| Performed By (title/area) | Required Action Steps | Supplemental Guidance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Nurse** | Perform BP measurement in the context of best practice | The patient should be comfortably positioned, either sitting or semi-reclining, with the back supported. Do not reposition the patient to a reclining position or side lying to lower the BP; this will result in a false reading. The patient's legs should not be crossed. The patient's upper arm should be bare, free of constrictive clothing, and supported at the level of the heart. The BP cuff should be the correct size. Nurses should be alert to variables that can affect blood pressure such as recent exposure to nicotine or pain. Severe range blood pressure measurement obtained with an automated cuff should be validated with a blood pressure measurement obtained with a manual cuff. |
| **Nurse** | If the patients SBP is greater than or equal to 160 mmHg, or the DBP is greater than or equal to 110 mmHg repeat BP in 15 minutes. If SBP remains $\\ge$ 160mm Hg or DBP remains $\\ge$ 110mm Hg with a physician order the nurse may administer Nifedipine 10 mg po x 1 dose, if no contraindications exist. | Provider must be notified immediately after administration. |
| **Nurse** | Notify charge nurse in L\&D or the mother-baby unit that a patients BP assessment meets criteria for a hypertensive emergency. | The charge nurse will assist with allocation of resources and determination of level of care. |
| **Physician / Resident / APP** | Primary provider, in-house OB hospitalist or resident to evaluate patient within 30 minutes of first severe range blood pressure. |  |
| **Nurse** | Initiate continuous electronic fetal monitoring if appropriate. |  |
| **Physician / Resident / APP / Nurse** | Treatment of acute-onset severe hypertension is an emergency and requires an immediate response. Antihypertensive medication should be administered within 30-60 minutes of the initial measurement of severe hypertension (see medication recommended options below). Goal is to achieve an SBP range of 130-150 mmHg and a DBP range of 80-100 mmHg. Initiate seizure precautions and begin magnesium sulfate infusion. Magnesium sulfate is not considered an antihypertensive medication (antihypertensive medication may not prevent eclampsia). | The provider may defer initiation of magnesium sulfate if contraindicated or clinically unwarranted. Assess BP as ordered by physician/LIP once target BP is reached |
| **OB Team** | Debrief is recommended for all patients with acute-onset severe hypertension |  |

### **Medication Table**

| Medication | Route | Initial Therapy | Onset | Peak | Max dose | Mechanism of Action | Side Effects |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Labetalol** | IV | 20mg | 2-5 mins | 15-30 mins | 140 mg | Arteriolar dilator Combined $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$-blocking agent | Reflex tachycardia Use with caution in patients with known asthma |
| **Nifedipine** (immediate release) | PO | 10mg | 5-20 mins | 30-60 mins | 120 mg | Calcium channel blocker Arteriolar dilator | Tachycardia, headache Flushing, light headedness, palpitations and scalp tingling |
| **Hydralazine** | IV | 5-10mg | 5-20 mins | 5 mins | 50mg | Arterial smooth muscle dilator Decreases heart rate | Headache Upper abdominal pain (rare) Nausea Vomiting Flushing |

### **Treatment Recommendations for Sustained Systolic BP $\\ge$ 160mm Hg or Diastolic BP $\\ge$ 110 mm Hg**

*Antihypertensive treatment and magnesium sulfate should be administered simultaneously if concurrent administration is not possible antihypertensive treatment should be 1 priority*

#### **Labetalol IV**

* **Initial dose 20mg**  
* Repeat BP in 10 mins  
* If SBP $\\ge$ 160 or DBP $\\ge$ 110: **Administer 40 mg**  
* Repeat BP in 10 mins  
* If SBP $\\ge$ 160 or DBP $\\ge$ 110: **Administer 80 mg**  
* Repeat BP in 10 mins  
* If SBP $\\ge$ 160 or DBP $\\ge$ 110: **Administer Hydralazine 10mg**  
* Repeat BP in 20 mins  
* If SBP $\\ge$ 160 or DBP $\\ge$ 110: **Administer Hydralazine 10mg** and obtain STAT consult with maternal-fetal medicine, internal medicine, anesthesia, or critical care subspecialists for transfer of care or continuous IV infusion

#### **Hydralazine IV**

* **Initial dose 5-10 mg**  
* Repeat BP in 20 mins

* Repeat BP in 10 mins  
* If SBP $\\ge$ 160 or DBP $\\ge$ 110: **Administer Labetalol 40mg** and obtain STAT consult with maternal-fetal medicine, internal medicine, anesthesia, or critical care subspecialists for transfer of care or continuous IV infusion

#### **Nifedipine PO**

* **Initial dose 10 mg**  
* Repeat BP in 20 mins
